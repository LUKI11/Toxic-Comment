# Toxic-Comment
This is my UQ thesis.
The aim of this Project is to use different algorithms to design a machine learning model which can recognize the bad comments and detect the type of comments by training and choose the best one.

Task:
Extract and clean comments from dataset
Tokenizing and Indexing comments
Use Logistic Regression (LR), Convolutional neural network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to build models
Compare the results from different alogrithms
Predict commens with the best model

Technicals: Numpy, Pandas, Regular Expression, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Keras
